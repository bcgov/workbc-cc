INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a heavily customized fork of Double Reference module.
Double Reference provides a single field item that contains two entity
reference fields.

One field is the primary that uses all the normal entity reference field forms,
the other is an attached field which has most, but not all, of the same options.
The two fields work together to form one field.

INSTALLATION

CONFIGURATION
-------------

has additional configuration for the added reference field.
